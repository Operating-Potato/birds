Big crow. Has a cool beard. I see ravens more often in winter once the smaller crows migrate.

<hr class="thin-line">

**Appearance:** one of the largest of all passerines, completely black and glossy all around. Throat sports a distinct scruffy patch of feathers that can be raised up, and the nostrils are covered in bristles as in all corvids. In flight, the tail feathers form a rounded wedge shape.

**Voice:** "kronk kronk kronk", "caaaw"

**Behaviour:** opportunistic ground forager. will eat carrion, nuts, small animals, eggs, and sometimes stuff found in a dumpster, storing excess food in caches. Very intelligent and can solve relatively complex problems to aquire food. May play with objects by picking them up and dropping them. Flies gracefully, very acrobatic compared to many other crows. 

**Known whereabouts:** Forests, town/city outskirts, mountains, dumps

**Seen in:** Edmonton, Banff, Improvement District No. 12
