A relatively large, black-and-white passerine, commonly found in open areas with scattered trees. Very beautiful, but quite noisy in the morning.

__Appearance:__ medium sized. Colouration is black and white overall, with iridescent wings and tail. Wings are short and broad, while retrices are ridiculously long, accounting for half of the bird's length.

__Voice:__ serveral vocalizations, including harsh-sounding "yak yak yak," long "wheeeaaah." Sometimes produces complex and quiet series of clicks, grunts, whistles, and squawks.

__Behaviour:__ often seen walking on ground; primarily scavenges but is opportunistic and will go for any easy meal. Flight is slow-ish, with a lot of flapping due to short wings and long tail. In family groups during spring and summer, in larger groups during autumn and winter. Fairly tolerant of human presence and approachable, but will usually keep distance from observer.

__Known wherabouts:__ open habitats with scattered trees. Highly adaptable, magpies can be found in urban areas as well, such as parks, lawns, and parking lot dumpsters.

__Seen in:__ Edmonton, Calgary
