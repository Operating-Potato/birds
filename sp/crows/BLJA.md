Rambunctious little fellow; it is quite talkative and noisy. Common in woodland and suburban areas.

<hr class="thin-line">

**Appearance:** medium-sized perching bird. As the name suggests, blue jays are very blue (the blue colouration is caused by small structures in the feathers), with the face and underside being white. Black stripes occur on the front and back of the head, the latter stripe extending below the throat to form a "chinstrap". The flight feathers are a more vibrant blue, with white tips and black stripes. Head sports a movable crest. 

**Voice:** usually loud and raucous, with typical calls including a harsh "keeew keeew" and various jumbly sounds such as "thlalp thlalp" and "skrealulgh". May also emit a quiet, mechanical series of sounds, the so-called "rusty pipe" call.

**Behaviour:** bold and investigating, primarily eats nuts but will opportunistically eat fruits, athropods, small vertebrates, and eggs. Sometimes hides extra food in caches.

**Known whereabouts:** deciduous woodlands, parks

**Seen in:** Edmonton, Wabanum
