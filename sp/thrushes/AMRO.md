Common thrush over much of North America. Often visits lawns.

**Appearance:** large thrush, with a prominent rusty red underside, dark grey head, and light grey wings and back. A discontinuous white ring surrounds each eye. Has a round body and somewhat long tail.

**Voice:** song is a melodic "churp, cheery-up, cheery-up, churp, cheery-up." Calls include a soft-sounding repeated "tuk," a rapidly-repeated "pik" alarm, and a startling laugh-like trill.

**Behaviour:** hops on the ground in search of worms, locating them by sight and pouncing upon them. Lays blue eggs in a cup nest located in a tree or shrub. In winter, eats fruits more often.

**Known whereabouts:** lawns, forests, parks. Somehow almost everywhere.

**Seen in:** Edmonton, Calgary, Elk Island National Park
