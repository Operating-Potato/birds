Large, big-billed finch with a striking colour. Very big bill. Very big green bill.

<hr class="thin-line">

**Appearance:** rather large finch. Both sexes are generally gray and gold, with a large white patch on otherwise dark wings. Males have a dark head and yellow "eyebrow." Chunky bill is light yellow, except during spring when it becomes light green.

**Voice:** calls resemble a louder version of that of a House Sparrow. Song is a shrill monotone ring.

**Behaviour:** often forages in flocks in trees, shrubs, and on the ground primarily for seeds, but also buds, fruits, sap, and insects.

**Known whereabouts:** probably in conifer forests; I've only seen them in someone's front yard.

**Seen in:** Wabanum
