Gradient-looking gull. Saw a juvenile once in California.

<hr class="thin-line">

**Appearance:** *breeding adult has a red beak on a white head that fades to dark grey below and even darker on the wings, as well as dark legs. Nonbreeding adults have a mottled grey head.* Juvenile birds are drastically different, being dark brown with a pale pink bill, and somewhat resembling petrels.

**Voice:** haven't heard anything from these guys yet.

**Behaviour:** the one I saw was flying over the water near the coast.

**Known whereabouts:** near-shore environments

**Seen in:** Laguna Beach
