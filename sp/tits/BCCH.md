A common tit native to much of North America, the Black-capped Chickadee is very bold for its size. Often very round.

**Appearance:** smaller than a House Sparrow, with a plump body and comparatively huge head. Overall grey, with a pale yellow belly, white cheek, and black cap and chin. Wing and tail feathers are slate-coloured and have white outlines.

**Voice:** song is a simple "fee bee," while calls are often complex, with the "chicka dee-dee-dee" call being the most common; the amount of "dees" is porportional to the level of alarm. 

**Behaviour:** very curious, almost fearless despite tiny stature. Primarily eats seeds and small insects, but will opportunistically eat other edible matter.  Can be found in groups of 3-5, and in winter is often leading mixed-species flocks.

**Known whereabouts:** deciduous and coniferous forests, riparian areas, suburban and urban parks.

**Seen in:** Edmonton, Calgary, Wabanum, Elk Island National Park
