Swift that is very… swift in flight. Holy canoli they're so fast…

**Appearance:** mostly dark brownish-grey with a small, barely-noticeable white patch on the throat. Extremely long, curved wings give the bird a crescent-shaped profile in flight.

**Voice:** haven't heard anything from these guys yet, or maybe I just don't remember.

**Behaviour:** very fast flier, gliding at rapid paces over open spaces. Often in small to medium-sized flocks.

**Known whereabouts:** over fields and lakes

**Seen in:** Beijing, Harbin
