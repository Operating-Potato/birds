North American goose of variable size. Has a reputation of being very menacing, giving it the title of "cobra chicken". 

<hr class="thin-line">

**Appearance:** medium to large-sized goose, mostly oval-shaped with a lanky neck sticking out the front. Most of the head and neck, as well as the legs, are black, while the back, wings, and tail are tan or brown. The underside is paler, fading to white near the vent and rump. Goslings are yellow and fuzzy. Size varies between subspecies.

**Voice:** easily recognizeable honking, usually similar to "ho-OOnk". Also hisses.

**Behaviour:** gregarious and can be found in large groups, especially from autumn to winter, when it may be found in groups numbering over 700 individuals. Feeds by grazing grasses and other low-growing plants on land, or by dabbling while swimming. Nests near water; geese are very protective of their precocial goslings. Can become territorial near nest sites, and when accustomed to human feeding may become aggressive seeking handouts. Known for V-shaped migration formations, though many southern populations are resident year-round.

**Known whereabouts:** near water; ponds, wetlands, rivers, lakes. Also fields with grass and sidewalks.

**Seen in:** Edmonton, Calgary, Wabanum
