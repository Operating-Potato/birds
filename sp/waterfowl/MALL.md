One of the most recognizable wild ducks (particularly in the Northern Hemisphere), mallards are also the ancestors of most domestic ducks. I see them often whenever I go to a lake or pond.

__Appearance:__ breeding males have shiny green heads, dark brown chests, gray body, and yellow bill. Females have a brown, mottled pattern and bill with black and orange spotches. Both have bright orange legs. Nonbreeding males are duller and have less extensive green on head.

__Voice:__ females calls comprise of "quack." Males have a similar call, but deeper and quieter.

__Behaviour:__ swims. Flaps quickly in flight. Social, and can be found with other duck species. Individuals in urban parks are usually very approachable and often take bits of food people give them.*

__Known whereabouts:__ Almost anywhere with a decent amount of water such as lakes, ponds, and rivers.

__Seen in:__ Edmonton, Elk Island National Park, Calgary, Toronto, Welland,  Niagara Falls, Harbin, Anaheim
