Hard to see because it's small and brown and looks like tree bark. Climbs trees.

**Appearance:** small songbird, with a curved bill and compact shape. Most of the plumage is mottled brown to camouflage with tree bark, while the underside is white.

**Voice:** song and calls are high pitched; the *song drops in pitch before going back up*, and calls can include trills and a short, two-part "fee fee."

**Behaviour:** climbs vertically in a spiral around a tree, then flies to the base of another one to begin again when finished.

**Known whereabouts:** woodlands; seems to prefer conifers.

**Seen in:** Edmonton
