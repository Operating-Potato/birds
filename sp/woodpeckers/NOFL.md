Common woodpecker with distinct yellow-shafted and red-shafted forms depending on geographic location*. Can be seen on the ground fairly often.

**Appearance:** medium-large woodpecker with a round crestless head and prominent dark spots on belly. **YELLOW-SHAFTED**: red nape on back of head, black malar patch near beak, yellow feather shafts on remiges/retrices. **RED-SHAFTED**: grey nape, red malar patch, orange-red feather shafts*.

**Voice:** series of laughing notes, as well as a loud "kleer." Drumming is rapid.

**Behaviour:** can be seen foraging both in trees and on the ground, and in the latter case will hunt ants and worms. Flickers may intentionally allow ants to sting them in a behaviour known as anting.

**Known whereabouts:** mixed areas of trees and open ground.

**Seen in:** Edmonton
