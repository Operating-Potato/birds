Rail that swims with lobed feet, rather than webbed. Quite fun to watch as they swim and do stuff.

<hr class="thin-line">

**Appearance:** black-and-white rail that resembles a semi-aquatic chicken. Beak and shield are the few white-coloured parts, with a small red callus on top of the latter. Eyes are red. The most notable features of a coot are its lobed toes; unlike many other waterbirds coots swim with flaps of skin along each toe rather than interconnected webbing. Chicks are very decorated after hatching, though their plumage fades with time.

**Voice:** high-pitched croaks and honks, similar to a kazoo.

**Behaviour:** forages for aquatic vegetation by diving and dabbling, *and occasionally eating grains on land*. Mediocre flier; runs on top of the water to take off. *Coots build their nests floating on vegetation such as reeds and cattails. Parents favour chicks with brighter ornamentation when feeding their young.*

**Known whereabouts:** wetlands, lakes, and other vegetated open water

**Seen in:** Edmonton, Wabanum
