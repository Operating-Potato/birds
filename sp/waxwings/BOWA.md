An extremely social bird that visits fruit-bearing shrubs en masse. Similar to Cedar Waxwing and Japanese Waxwing but is larger and less yellow. 

**Appearance:** plump, with a tuft of feathers forming a crest on the head. Has has two dark markings on head: an L-shaped one on the eye, and a rounder patch on the throat. Smooth-looking plumage is mostly grey-ish, though the head has an orange-brown wash and the undertail area is completely rufous. Bright yellow and white markings on tail and wings, with the namesake red tips on the secondaries.

**Voice:** high-pitched descending trill, lower in pitch than a Cedar Waxwing call.

**Behaviour:** can be found searching for fruits and berries in very large flocks, sometimes numbering over a hundred birds. A flock will descend all at once when they find a supply of berries such as mountain ash.  Less social during summer, often taking insects.

**Known whereabouts:** in winter, anywhere with a fruit supply. In summer, probably in boreal forest.

**Seen in:** Wabanum
